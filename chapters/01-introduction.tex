\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:intro:background}

% \instructions{
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Awaken the reader's interest and convince her why the theme is important.
%     \item Background information might be historical in nature, or it might refer to previous research or practical considerations.
%     \item Provide an example or use case for the problem.
%     \item It should be written on a level that it's understandable by anyone with a computer science master's degree.
%     \item It might contain a small handful of citations if it is needed to justify some main claims or assumptions, but this is not the part to detail any related work and/or compare among each other.
% \end{itemize}

The process of creating a presentation from a research paper can be a time consuming and tedious task. The goal of this project is to automate this process, by creating a system that can automatically generate presentations from research papers.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:intro:objectives}

% \instructions{
% \begin{itemize}
%    \item Define the goals of your study. It might be presented as a bullet list.
%   \item Structure your goal by Research Questions (RQs). Describe each of the problems to address in your work and formulate for it a clear research question.``The problem of bla is about$\dots$, We formulate the following RQ1 Can we provide a method for bla such that bla bla''
% \end{itemize}
% }

The main objective of this thesis is to create a system that can automatically generate presentations from research papers. In detail, the research papers will be in LaTeX format and the presentations will be in LaTeX Beamer format. In order to achieve this objective, the following research questions will be addressed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item RQ1: Can we generate a dataset of research papers and their presentation in the required LaTeX and Beamer formats?
  \item RQ2: Can we provide a method for extracting the relevant information from a research paper?
  \item RQ3: Can we provide a method for summarizing the extracted information?
  \item RQ4: Can we provide a method for generating a coherent and high-quality presentation from the summarized information?
\end{itemize}

\section{Approach and Contributions}
\label{sec:intro:approach}

% \instructions{
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Give a brief summary of your overall approach.
%   \item Summarize the specific contributions that you made in this thesis (e.g., a task definition, a method or model, a test collection, empirical results, analysis, etc.). It might be presented as a bullet list.
% \end{itemize}
% }

Creating a presentation from a research paper can be viewed as either a summarization task or an extractive task, or a combination of both. The system will extract the relevant information from the paper and then summarize it in a presentation. The system will be evaluated on how well it can extract the relevant information from the paper and how well it can summarize it in a presentation.

\section{Outline}
\label{sec:intro:outline}

% \instructions{
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Give an overview of the main points and the structure of your thesis. ``Chapter 2 covers ... Chapter 3 describes ... ''
%     \item Show in a natural way how the different parts (chapters) relate to each other.
% \end{itemize}

The rest of this thesis is structured as follows. Chapter~\ref{ch:related} discusses relevant work related to the tasks of summarizing, extracting, and generating presentations based on documents and reports. Chapter~\ref{ch:approach} describes in detail the approach developed in this thesis in order to create the Automatic Generation of Presentations for Research Papers (AGPRP) system. Chapter~\ref{ch:eval} evaluates the results of the AGPRP system by looking av various metrics. Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} wraps up and concludes the thesis.
