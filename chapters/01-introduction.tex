Converting research findings into presentations is a crucial task in academic and professional settings. However, it can be quite challenging. This process involves transforming detailed research papers into clear, engaging presentations that cater to various audiences, ranging from conference attendees to students. It demands a considerable amount of time, profound subject knowledge, and expertise in information design and storytelling skills.

The goal is to create a system that can automatically generate presentations from academic papers. This system will aim to improve efficiency and bridge the gap between detailed research and audience-friendly presentations. By automating this process, researchers and professionals will have more time and cognitive resources to focus on their primary work. Moreover, such a system will ensure that their findings reach a wider audience.

Automating the process of creating academic presentation slides involves several challenges. The system must accurately interpret the complex language used in academic papers, which are often filled with specific terminology and data. It should be able to identify the key points in a paper, understand the significance of different findings, and translate this information into visually appealing slides. Additionally, it must be able to adapt to the different conventions followed by various research fields, which have their own unique ways of presenting and arguing their findings.

To tackle the difficulties faced in academic research, significant advancements in natural language processing, information retrieval, and the use of machine learning, graph databases, and vector databases are required. By utilizing these technologies, it is possible to process and visually represent the complex content of academic papers. The development of such a system would considerably enhance the automation of knowledge dissemination, making it easier for academics and professionals to convert research papers into presentations. This, in turn, will increase the accessibility and impact of their work, providing greater opportunities for future research and collaborations.

The main objective of this thesis is to create an innovative system that can generate presentations automatically from academic research papers. Specifically, the system will convert research papers written in \LaTeX{} into presentations formatted in the \LaTeX{} Beamer framework. The purpose of this project is to make the process of sharing knowledge more efficient and accessible. To achieve this, the thesis will explore several critical research questions, each designed to address a distinct aspect of the system's development process.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1: Dataset Generation} – The first research question aims to determine whether it is possible to create a comprehensive dataset that includes research papers and their corresponding presentations, both formatted according to \LaTeX{} and Beamer specifications. This is a crucial step towards developing the proposed system, as it investigates the availability of source material needed for training and testing. The process will involve identifying potential sources for such documents, curating the dataset, and implementing strategies to ensure that it is diverse and representative.
  
  \item \textbf{RQ2: Information Extraction} – The second question deals with the methods to extract relevant information from research papers. This involves creating or using natural language processing techniques to identify and isolate important points, findings, and data within the complex structure of academic papers. The challenge here is two-fold: accurately discerning the content's significance among the academic jargon and structurally diverse formats of research papers.
  
  \item \textbf{RQ3: Information Summarization} – This question is a continuation of the previous one. It's about summarizing extracted information into a shorter form while retaining the main message. This summarization process is important when presenting research findings on slides. The research will explore the algorithms and techniques used for effective summarization, ensuring that the most important information is highlighted while maintaining the research's integrity and context.
  
  \item \textbf{RQ4: Presentation Generation} – The final question seeks to establish a methodology for converting summarized information into coherent and high-quality presentations. This includes not only the textual content but also the design and aesthetic aspects of the slides. The challenge is to automate the process of creating presentations that are not only informative but also visually appealing and engaging for the audience. This will require using design principles, information hierarchy, and customizable templates to create presentations that effectively communicate research findings.
\end{itemize}

This research aims to answer important questions that will benefit both academics and educators. It will provide a new tool to help them process and present documents automatically, which is currently a challenging task. The goal is to offer a comprehensive solution to the time-consuming process of presentation creation. By doing so, it will help enhance the accessibility and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Through rigorous investigation and development, this research will push the boundaries of what is possible in automatic document processing and presentation generation.

Converting a research paper into a presentation requires a complex process that may involve summarizing or extracting key elements, or a combination of both. This thesis presents a new system called TEX2BEAM, which automates the creation of presentation slides in \LaTeX{} Beamer format from research papers formatted in \LaTeX{}. The TEX2BEAM system is designed to intelligently navigate through the dense academic text of a research paper, extract relevant information, and distill it into a clear and concise presentation format.

The operational framework of TEX2BEAM is based on a set of advanced algorithms and methodologies that are designed to comprehend the intricate structure and content of academic papers. At first, the system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text. It identifies and classifies various sections of the paper, such as the abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. This step is pivotal in identifying the particular parts of the text that are most likely to contain crucial insights and findings that are relevant to a summarized presentation.

TEX2BEAM uses a combination of extractive and abstractive summarization techniques to create a presentation from a research paper. In the extractive phase, the system selects verbatim snippets that represent the main ideas and findings from the text. Then, in the abstractive phase, these ideas are rephrased and condensed into more concise statements that are tailored for slide-based presentation. This approach ensures that the presentation effectively captures the essence of the research paper while being engaging and accessible for the audience.

The TEX2BEAM system has a vital component in the form of an algorithm that organizes the summarized content into a well-structured and visually attractive presentation. This includes selecting the best sequence of slides, and generating or choosing suitable visual aids like figures, tables, and charts. Moreover, the algorithm applies design principles to improve readability and viewer engagement.

The TEX2BEAM tool will be thoroughly tested to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. The tests will measure its ability to accurately extract relevant information from research papers and create effective presentations. The evaluation will include metrics such as the accuracy of information extraction, the clarity and conciseness of the summarization, and the overall quality of the generated presentations. This evaluation will demonstrate the potential of TEX2BEAM as a valuable tool for academics and professionals, making the process of creating presentations easier and facilitating the sharing of research findings.
